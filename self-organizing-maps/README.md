# Project Title

Self-Organizing-Maps on Audio Dataset

# Project Description

A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map.

This project aims to cluster the loudness of the input data.
